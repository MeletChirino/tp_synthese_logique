# TP synthese Logique

First we simulate our file with [GHDL](http://ghdl.free.fr/) and [GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/) to visualize the results. This is our simulation.

### Simulation 12h

There is a bug in init12 but it is because all of the sync with the clock's rising edges.

Next step is to synthetyse at AIME.
